Datasets we intend to use: Census CSV file, Zipcode CSV, googlemaps API (for car 
dealerships)
 
Useful investigation to be done with final DB: 
We are looking to find out if there is a relationship between the economic situation per 
household to vehicle ownership based on the number of dealerships in the area. 

Is the final DB relational/non-relational: Relational (SQL)
We chose to use SQL as our database because we are mainly using structured data with a 
consistent schema. We would not be having any scalability issues now.
